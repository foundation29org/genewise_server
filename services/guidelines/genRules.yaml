# DETAILED Process for generating the simplified report from the official genetic report

        Evaluate 'Results', 'Conclusions', and 'Annex_I' sections of the official report.
        Returns TRUE if ANY of the following conditions are met:
        1. 'Results' or 'Conclusions' contain text explicitly indicating a causal P/LP finding
           (e.g., "a pathogenic variant in X that explains the clinical presentation is identified",
           "result compatible with diagnosis of Y", "genetic confirmation of Z").
        2. 'Annex_I' lists a variant classified as Pathogenic (P) or Likely Pathogenic (LP)
           AND the 'Interpretation' or 'Conclusions' section or the associated text in 'Annex_I'
           explicitly links it as the cause of the patient's clinical presentation/phenotype.
        Returns FALSE otherwise (e.g., "no variants identified", VUS as the only relevant finding, P/LP not related to phenotype).

        2. Meet the criteria defined for section 4 of the simplified report:
           - Classified as VUS (and potentially relevant to the phenotype according to the original report's interpretation - *avoid including VUS deemed clearly irrelevant*).
           - Classified as P/LP but explicitly *not* considered causal in the original report (e.g., heterozygous in a recessive gene without a second variant, P/LP in a gene unrelated to phenotype).
           - CNVs listed in Annex I.
           - Specific polymorphisms mentioned in Annex I *only if* the interpretation discusses potential clinical relevance (even if conditional).
        Store relevant details of these variants (Gene, CDNA, Protein, Genotype, Classification, **OriginalReportInterpretationSummary**).
        **Crucially**: Capture a concise summary of the *original report's interpretation* for each finding, noting its level of certainty and any caveats.

potential_ambiguities_and_challenges:
  - point: Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
    description: >
      Determining `primary_finding_exists`, extracting/simplifying `Interpretation`, and now accurately capturing the **level of certainty** and **specific caveats** (like CNV validation needs, mention of predictive tools for VUS, conditionality of polymorphisms) rely even more heavily on sophisticated NLU. Variability in original report wording remains a key challenge.
  - point: External Data Dependency
    description: >
      Searching for information about pathologies, gene inheritance (OMIM, Orphanet), and now also about **variable expressivity** or **reduced penetrance** requires access to updated external databases. Availability, consistency, and interpretability of these data may vary. A strategy is needed to handle missing or conflicting data.
  - point: Variability in Official Reports
    description: >
      Official reports can vary in format, level of detail, and exact location of information. Rules must be robust or require adjustments. How **uncertainties** or **warnings** are phrased can vary significantly.
  - point: Subjectivity of Simplification & Caution
    description: >
      The appropriate level of "simplification" and how to phrase the required "caution" are subjective. The rules attempt to capture the intent, but generating text that is accurate, cautious, and comprehensible requires a delicate balance, possibly needing human validation. **Avoiding over-interpretation now requires active constraint during generation.**
  - point: Inference vs. Explicit Information
    description: >
      Determining if "variable expressivity" is relevant or if a specific warning from the original report should be included might require inference if not explicitly tagged, adding complexity.
  - point: Handling Edge Cases
    description: >
      Complex cases (e.g., mosaicism, digenic inheritance, multiple primary findings, complex variants like large or difficult-to-interpret CNVs) may not be fully covered and would require additional logic or manual handling. Logic for CNVs and polymorphisms has been improved but may need further refinement.
  - point: Implementation of Constraints
    description: >
      The `summarization_caution` constraint is a meta-instruction. Its effective implementation depends on the system's (e.g., LLM's) ability to apply it consistently across all summarization and text generation steps.
