CorePrinciples:
  - rule: "Know Your Audience & Context"
    desc: "Understand their background, comprehension needs, and *when/how* they receive this information (e.g., post-counseling)."
  - rule: "Use Appropriate Tone"
    desc: "Professional but simple, direct, and respectful. Avoid condescension."
  - rule: "Assume Limited Topic Knowledge"
    desc: "Explain core concepts clearly, assuming no prior specific genetic knowledge."
  - rule: "Prioritize Accuracy Above All"
    desc: "Simplification should *never* lead to inaccurate or misleading information, especially with medical/genetic terms."

HandlingTerminology:
  - rule: "Prioritize Simple, Common Words (When Accurate)"
    desc: "Use everyday language *only* if it doesn't compromise technical accuracy."
  - rule: "Explain Necessary Terms: Inline & Glossary"
    desc: "Define unavoidable technical (e.g., genetic) terms briefly *immediately* upon first use. Provide a more detailed, accurate definition in the glossary."
  - rule: "Use Correct & Consistent Terminology"
    desc: "Employ technical terms accurately and *identically* to how they appear in the source technical report. Do not alter established terminology."
  - rule: "Be Highly Consistent"
    desc: "Use the *exact same term* for the *same concept* throughout. Avoid unnecessary synonyms."
  - rule: "Avoid/Explain Acronyms & Abbreviations"
    desc: "Avoid if possible. If used, define fully on first use (e.g., Virtual Private Network (VPN))."
  - rule: "Avoid Foreign Words (Unless Standard/Essential)"
    desc: "Stick to the primary language unless a foreign term is common usage or unavoidable."
  - rule: "Use Concrete Examples & Analogies Carefully"
    desc: "Illustrate concepts with relatable examples, ensuring the analogy doesn't oversimplify or mislead."
  - rule: "Simplify Numbers & Percentages (Maintain Precision)"
    desc: "Use digits (1, 2, 3). Explain percentages simply (e.g., '50% or half'), but ensure explanations don't distort medical/statistical meaning. Consider simple charts (creation handled elsewhere)."

WritingStyleAndStructure:
  - rule: "Short, Direct Sentences"
    desc: "One main idea per sentence. Use periods frequently."
  - rule: "Active Voice & Direct Statements"
    desc: "Prefer active voice ('The system saves...'). State information directly; avoid phrases like 'The report mentions that...'; instead, state *what* it mentions."
  - rule: "Use Direct Address ('You') Carefully"
    desc: "Use 'You' for instructions, but avoid overly personal phrasing for sensitive information like inheritance patterns. Prefer impersonal statements (see rule below)."
  - rule: "Use Impersonal Phrasing for General Probabilities/Statements"
    desc: "Avoid phrasing implying confirmed status for relatives (e.g., instead of 'Your children have a 50% chance...', use 'Each child of a person with this condition has a 50% chance...')."
  - rule: "Prefer Positive Phrasing (When Clear)"
    desc: "State what to do, rather than what not to do, where possible and unambiguous."
  - rule: "Ensure Clear Pronoun References"
    desc: "Make it obvious what 'it', 'they', 'this' refer to. Repeat the noun if ambiguity is possible."
  - rule: "Logical & Simple Order"
    desc: "Structure information sequentially for steps, or general-to-specific for descriptions."
  - rule: "Group Related Information"
    desc: "Keep details about the same component, gene, or sub-topic together."
  - rule: "Be Concise: Focus on Essential Information"
    desc: "Include only what's needed for understanding *within the scope of this document*. Avoid excessive length."
  - rule: "Avoid Redundant External References"
    desc: "Do not include sentences directing readers to services they've already completed (e.g., avoid 'Discuss this with your genetic counselor' if the report is given *after* counseling)."
  - rule: "Simple Punctuation"
    desc: "Avoid complex punctuation (; : --) and special characters (& < ยง #) where simpler alternatives exist."
  - rule: "Clear, Descriptive Headings"
    desc: "Use headings to structure content logically. Ensure they accurately reflect content."
  - rule: "Use Lists for Steps or Items"a
    desc: "Employ bullet points or numbered lists."
  - rule: "Repeat Critical Information Sparingly"
    desc: "Reinforce crucial instructions or definitions only if necessary for safety or core understanding, ensuring consistency."
  - rule: "Highlight Key Information (Styling Handled Elsewhere)"
    desc: "Structure content so important info (e.g., key findings) is easy to find. Actual highlighting is a formatting concern."
 - rule: "Maintain Accurate & Accessible Glossary"
    desc: "Glossary definitions must be precise and avoid oversimplification that could be misleading *in context*. The goal is accurate understanding of the *actual* terms used in the report."
